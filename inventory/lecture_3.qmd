# Geometry and geocoding

## Latitude and longitude

Latitude and longitude are a set of geographic coordinates used to describe a location on the Earth's surface. Latitude is the angular distance of a point on the Earth's surface north or south of the equator, which is an imaginary line that circles the Earth at 0 degrees latitude. Longitude, on the other hand, is the angular distance of a point on the Earth's surface east or west of the prime meridian, which is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, at 0 degrees longitude.

Latitude is measured in degrees, with values ranging from 0 degrees at the equator to 90 degrees at the North and South Poles. Longitude is also measured in degrees, with values ranging from 0 degrees at the prime meridian to 180 degrees at the International Date Line on the opposite side of the Earth. Together, latitude and longitude provide a precise way to identify any location on the Earth's surface.

## Geometry types

Geometries are the basic building blocks of simple features. The most commonly used simple features geometries, used to represent a single feature are:

-   **Point**: The basis for each geometry type is the point. e.g.; *Point* (5 2)
-   **Multipoint**: A combination of multiple Points. e.g.; *Multipoint* (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2)
-   **Linestring**: A linestring is a sequence of points with a straight line connecting the points. e.g.; *Linestring* (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)
-   **Multilinestring**: A combination of multiple Linestrings. e.g.; *Multilinestring* ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4))
-   **Polygon**: A polygon is a sequence of points that form a closed, non-intersecting ring. Closed means that the first and the last point of a polygon have the same coordinate. e.g.; Polygon without a hole: *Polygon* ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5))
-   **Multipolygon**: A combination of multiple Polygons. e.g.; *Multipolygon* (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)))
-   **Geometrycollection**: A geometry collection can contain any combination of geometries including (multi)points and linestrings. e.g.; *Geometrycollection* (Multipoint (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), Linestring (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2))

## Geocoding and reverse geocoding

Geocoding is the process of converting a human-readable address, such as a street address, city, state or postal code, into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) that can be understood and used by mapping software or other geographic information systems (GIS). This enables locations to be plotted on a map, and helps to facilitate a wide range of applications, including location-based services, logistics, and urban planning.

Geocoding can be done manually or automatically, using a variety of methods, including using publicly available address data sets, reverse geocoding (i.e., converting coordinates to human-readable addresses), and machine learning algorithms that can recognize and interpret natural language addresses.

Geocoding is important for several reasons:

1.  **Mapping and Location-based Services**: Geocoding is essential for mapping and location-based services, such as Google Maps, Uber, and Lyft. Without geocoding, these services would not be able to accurately locate and provide directions to specific addresses.

2.  **Spatial Analysis**: Geocoding enables spatial analysis, which is the analysis of data in relation to geographic location. Spatial analysis can reveal patterns and relationships that might not be evident from the data alone, and can help with decision-making in a variety of fields, including urban planning, public health, and environmental science.

3.  **Emergency Services**: Geocoding is critical for emergency services, as it helps emergency responders quickly and accurately locate people and places that need assistance during emergencies such as natural disasters or accidents.

4.  **Business and Marketing**: Geocoding is also useful for businesses and marketing purposes. Companies can use geocoding to analyze sales data by location, identify potential new markets, and target advertising campaigns to specific geographic regions.

Overall, geocoding is an essential tool that helps us better understand and interact with the world around us.

### Geocoding is useful for survey and natural experiment research in several ways:

1.  **Identifying Study Areas**: Geocoding can be used to identify study areas and select samples based on specific geographic criteria. For example, researchers can use geocoding to identify neighborhoods with high levels of air pollution or areas prone to natural disasters.

2.  **Improving Data Accuracy**: Geocoding can help to improve the accuracy of survey and natural experiment data by providing precise location information. This information can be used to validate data collected from participants or to verify the location of events or incidents being studied.

3.  **Analyzing Spatial Patterns**: Geocoding can help researchers to identify spatial patterns and relationships between variables that are not apparent through traditional statistical methods. For example, researchers can use geocoding to examine the relationship between the location of fast food restaurants and rates of obesity in a particular area.

4.  **Conducting Spatial Analysis**: Geocoding can be used to conduct spatial analysis, which is a powerful tool for understanding how the physical environment influences health and behavior. Spatial analysis can help researchers to identify clusters of disease or health outcomes and to understand the factors that contribute to these patterns.

Overall, geocoding is a valuable tool for survey and natural experiment research because it provides a way to incorporate location data into analyses and to better understand the spatial patterns and relationships between variables.
