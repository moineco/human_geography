# Lecture 5: Political geography – borders, states, and geopolitics

Definition:

-   Political geography examines how geographical space influences political processes and how political decisions shape geography.
-   Key topics include borders, states, nationalism, geopolitics, and territorial disputes.

Why It Matters:

-   There are 195 recognized sovereign states today, but many territories remain disputed.
-   Conflicts over borders, resources, and political ideologies shape global stability.
-   Geopolitical strategies influence economic policies, military conflicts, and international relations.

### Key Questions in Political Geography

-   What defines a state, nation, and nation-state?
-   How are borders created, and why do disputes arise?
-   How does geography influence global politics and power struggles?
-   What is the role of international organizations in maintaining peace?

## The Concept of the State and Sovereignty

### What is a State?

A state (country) is a politically organized territory with:

-   Defined boundaries.
-   Permanent population.
-   A government with sovereignty (full control over internal/external affairs).
-   Recognition by other states.

Examples:

-   Sovereign States: France, Japan, Canada.
-   Disputed Territories: Palestine, Taiwan, Western Sahara (partially recognized).

### Nation vs. State vs. Nation-State

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Nation | A group of people with shared culture, language, history, and identity | Kurds, Basques, Palestinians |
| State | A politically defined territory with sovereignty | USA, Brazil, Germany |
| Nation-State | A country where the population is culturally homogeneous | Japan, Iceland, Denmark |
| Multinational State | A state with multiple ethnic groups with political autonomy | Canada, India, Russia |
| Stateless Nation | A nation without an official state | Kurds, Palestinians, Rohingya |

Case Study: The Kurdish Stateless Nation

-   30 million Kurds live across Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria.
-   Seeking independence but face resistance from existing states.

## Borders and Boundaries

### Types of Political Boundaries

Natural Boundaries – Based on physical features (rivers, mountains).

-   Example: The Rio Grande River separates the USA and Mexico.

Geometric Boundaries – Straight-line borders often drawn by colonial powers.

-   Example: Borders of African nations (e.g., Algeria-Libya-Niger).

Cultural Boundaries – Based on language, religion, or ethnicity.

-   Example: India-Pakistan border (Hindu-Muslim divide).

Superimposed Boundaries – Imposed by external forces, often without regard for cultural divisions.

-   Example: Berlin Conference (1884) divided Africa among European powers.

Case Study: The Partition of India (1947)

-   British-drawn borders split India and Pakistan, leading to mass migration and violence.
-   Over 15 million people displaced due to religious divisions.

### Border Disputes

Territorial Disputes – Conflicts over land ownership.

-   Example: Israel-Palestine conflict over West Bank and Gaza.

Resource Disputes – Conflicts over natural resources.

-   Example: South China Sea (oil, fisheries).

Functional Disputes – Disagreements over border management.

-   Example: USA-Mexico border (immigration, security).

## Geopolitics and Power Struggles

### Geopolitical Theories

Heartland Theory (Mackinder, 1904)

-   "Who controls Eastern Europe controls the world."
-   Suggested Russia’s dominance due to its central location and land power.
-   Influence: Soviet Union’s Cold War strategy.

Rimland Theory (Spykman, 1942)

-   "Control of coastal areas is key to global power."
-   Justified USA’s military presence in Asia and the Middle East.

World-Systems Theory (Wallerstein, 1970s)

Core-Periphery Model:

-   Core nations (USA, UK, Japan) dominate trade and industry.
-   Periphery nations (Africa, Latin America) supply raw materials.
-   Semi-periphery nations (China, India, Brazil) industrializing but still dependent.

Case Study: The Cold War and Geopolitical Rivalry

-   USA (capitalism) vs. USSR (communism).
-   Proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan.
-   Formation of military alliances: NATO vs. Warsaw Pact.

## Political Organizations and International Relations

### International Organizations

| Organization | Purpose | Example |
|----|----|----|
| United Nations (UN) | Peacekeeping, diplomacy | Resolutions on Ukraine-Russia war |
| European Union (EU) | Economic and political cooperation | Euro currency, open borders |
| North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) | Military alliance for collective defense | Support for Ukraine |
| World Trade Organization (WTO) | Regulates global trade | Trade dispute resolutions |
| African Union (AU) | African unity and development | Peace missions in Sudan |

Case Study: Brexit and the European Union

- UK left the EU in 2020 over concerns of sovereignty and immigration.
- Economic and political impacts still ongoing.

## Takeaway

- Political geography examines how borders, states, and power shape global relations.
- Geopolitical theories explain conflicts and strategies.
