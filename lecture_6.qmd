# Lecture 6: Urban Geography – Cities, Infrastructure, and Planning

Definition:

-   Urban geography studies the spatial organization of cities, urbanization processes, infrastructure development, and urban planning.

Why It Matters:

-   More than 55% of the global population lives in cities (expected to reach 70% by 2050).
-   Urbanization shapes economic, environmental, and social structures.
-   Infrastructure and planning impact sustainability, quality of life, and economic development.

### Key Questions in Urban Geography

-   What factors drive urbanization?
-   How do cities grow and develop?
-   What challenges do urban areas face?
-   How can urban planning improve cities for the future?

## The Process of Urbanization

### What is Urbanization?

Urbanization: The increasing percentage of a population living in urban areas.

Causes of Urbanization:

-   Industrialization (factories, jobs).
-   Economic Opportunities (trade, services).
-   Migration (rural-to-urban movement).
-   Infrastructure Development (roads, electricity).
-   Government Policies (urban housing, smart cities).

### Urbanization Trends

| Region | Urban Population (%) 1990 | Urban Population (%) 2022 | Projected (%) 2050 |
|----|----|----|----|
| North America | 75% | 82% | 89% |
| Europe | 70% | 74% | 83% |
| Latin America | 65% | 79% | 86% |
| Asia | 32% | 51% | 64% |
| Africa | 27% | 43% | 59% |

Case Study: China's Rapid Urbanization

- More than 300 million rural people migrated to cities in 30 years.
- Growth of megacities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen.
- Impact: Increased economic growth but also environmental pollution and housing crises.

## The Structure of Cities
### Urban Models: How Cities Are Organized

Concentric Zone Model (Burgess, 1925)

- City grows outward in rings.
- CBD (Central Business District) at the core.
- Example: Chicago, USA.

Sector Model (Hoyt, 1939)

- Cities develop in wedges based on transportation and industry.
- Example: Calgary, Canada (wealthier neighborhoods along transit lines).

Multiple Nuclei Model (Harris & Ullman, 1945)

- Cities have multiple centers for different activities.
- Example: Los Angeles, USA (downtown, industrial zones, suburban malls).

Latin American City Model

- Wealthy live near the central business district.
- Poorer populations in peripheral slums (favelas, barrios).
- Example: São Paulo, Brazil.

## Infrastructure and Urban Services
### Essential Urban Infrastructure

- Transportation: Roads, public transit, airports.
- Utilities: Water, electricity, sewage, internet.
- Housing: Affordable housing, high-rise apartments, suburban homes.
- Public Spaces: Parks, libraries, cultural centers.

Case Study: Smart Cities in Singapore

- Singapore uses AI, sensors, and automation to improve traffic, energy use, and waste management.
- Goal: Reduce pollution and create an efficient, livable city.

### Transportation and Urban Mobility

Public Transport vs. Private Vehicles

- Efficient metro and bus systems reduce congestion.
- Example: Tokyo’s extensive subway system reduces car dependence.

Urban Sprawl:

- Low-density suburbs lead to increased car usage and long commutes.
- Example: Los Angeles, USA suffers from extreme traffic congestion.

## Urban Challenges and Solutions
### Challenges of Rapid Urbanization

Overcrowding and Housing Shortages

- Slums and informal settlements (e.g., Dharavi in Mumbai).
- Rising property prices force people out of city centers.
- Traffic Congestion and Pollution
   - Air pollution from vehicles and industries.
   - Example: New Delhi’s air pollution crisis.

Urban Inequality and Poverty

- Gentrification displaces low-income residents.
- Example: San Francisco’s rising housing costs due to tech industry growth.

Waste Management and Sanitation

- Cities generate massive waste, overwhelming landfill capacity.
- Example: Jakarta, Indonesia struggles with flooding due to plastic waste clogging drainage.

## Urban Planning and Sustainable Cities
### What is Urban Planning?

- Urban planning designs cities to be more efficient, sustainable, and livable.
- Goals: Reduce congestion, improve green spaces, manage growth.

### Smart Growth Strategies

- Mixed-Use Development: Combines housing, business, and recreation in the same area.
- Public Transport Investment: Expanding metros, buses, bike lanes.
- Green Spaces: More parks and trees for better air quality.
- Renewable Energy Use: Solar, wind power to reduce carbon footprint.

Case Study: Curitiba, Brazil – A Model Sustainable City

- Implemented Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system to reduce car dependency.
- Green spaces and flood management to improve urban resilience.

## The Future of Cities
### Trends in Urban Development

- Rise of Megacities: More cities with 10+ million people (e.g., Lagos, Dhaka).
- Technology-Driven Cities: Smart grids, automated traffic control, AI-based services.
- Climate-Resilient Cities: Managing floods, heat waves, and sea-level rise.
- Decentralization: Smaller cities growing to balance development (e.g., China's secondary cities).

## Takeaway

- Urban geography helps us understand how cities grow and function.
- Infrastructure and planning shape livability and sustainability.
- Smart growth strategies and sustainable planning are key for the future.

## Quizzes

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of urbanization?
- How does urban planning affect social and economic inequality?
- Should cities prioritize public transportation over car-friendly policies?
- Can slums be upgraded, or should governments relocate informal settlers?
