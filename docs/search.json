    "text": "1.1 Branches of Geography\nThe word geography, invented by the ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes, is based on two Greek words, “Geo” means “Earth,” and “Graphy” means “to write.” Geography is the study of where things are found on Earth’s surface and the reasons for their locations.\nHuman geographers ask two questions:\nTo introduce human geography, we concentrate on two main features of society: culture and economy. The lectures explain why the most important cultural features, such as languages, religions, and ethnicities, are arranged as they are across Earth. The lecture also looks at the distribution of the most important economic activities, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services.\nWe tend to focus on two big decisions: who we choose as our life partner and what we do for work. But there is a third big decision—where you choose to live. The decision about where may be the most important, because it has a huge bearing on the others.\nWhere you choose to live affects every aspect of your being. It influences the income you can potentially earn, and how far you can develop your skills. It has a bearing on the friends and romantic partners you can potentially meet, the networks you can build, and the options that will be available to your children. It shapes your values and your politics. It plays a role in how happy and healthy you are, and in your overall quality of life.\nHumans possess a strong sense of place—that is, a feeling for the features that contribute to the distinctiveness of a particular spot on Earth—perhaps a hometown, vacation destination, or college. Describing the features of a place is an essential building block for geographers to explain similarities, differences, and changes across Earth.\nGeographers describe a feature’s place on Earth by identifying its location, which is the position that something occupies on Earth’s surface. In doing so, they consider three ways to identify location: place name, site, and situation. Geographers analyze where particular places are located and the combination of features that make each place on Earth distinct. Because all inhabited places on Earth’s surface—and many uninhabited places—have been named, the most straightforward way to describe a particular location is often by referring to its place name.",

    "text": "11.1 Shapefile in GIS\nShapefile is important for GIS (Geographic Information System) due to its widespread use and compatibility with various software applications. Here are a few key reasons:\nData Representation: Shapefile is a popular file format for storing and sharing geospatial data. It allows the representation of complex geographic features such as points, lines, and polygons, along with their attributes.\nInteroperability: Shapefile is supported by a wide range of GIS software, making it highly inter-operable. It enables data exchange between different systems and facilitates collaboration among users who may be using different GIS platforms.\nAttribute Management: Shapefile supports the storage of attribute data associated with geographic features. This allows for the integration of non-spatial information, such as population, land use, or temperature, with spatial data, enabling comprehensive analysis and visualization.\nCompact and Efficient: Shapefiles are relatively small in size compared to other data formats, making them efficient for storing and transferring geospatial data. They are also capable of handling large data-sets without compromising performance.\nHistorical Significance: Shapefile has been in use for several decades and has become a standard in the GIS community. Many legacy datasets and applications are based on shapefiles, making them crucial for historical data preservation and compatibility.",

    "section": "11.2 Shapefile and R",
    "text": "11.2 Shapefile and R\nShapefile is commonly used with R, a powerful programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Here’s why shapefile is often preferred for use with R:\nNative Support: R has built-in support for reading, writing, and manipulating shapefiles. The “sf” package in R provides functions specifically designed for working with spatial data, including shapefiles. This native support simplifies the process of loading shapefiles into R and performing various spatial analyses.\nVisualization Capabilities: R offers extensive visualization capabilities for geospatial data. Packages like “ggplot2” and “leaflet” enable you to create high-quality maps and interactive visualizations using shapefiles as the data source. R’s flexibility in customizing plots allows for advanced geospatial visualizations and exploration.\n\nWhile shapefile is a common choice for working with spatial data in R, it’s important to note that R also supports other geospatial file formats, such as GeoJSON and Geopackage. These formats may offer advantages like improved data compression, support for more advanced spatial features, and better inter-operability with certain software ecosystems.\n\n\nUse pacman to manage the R packages\nUsing packman package enables us to install and load a package without typing install.packges() at Console on your RStudio\nYou need to type the following command at Console on your RStudio\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"pacman\")\n\n\nThe installation of necessary R packages:\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, rnaturalearth)",

Fortunately, the map_data contains a feature CONTINTENT, so we can easily filter out the unwanted countries.\n\n\n\nLets try to plot a map of European countries. New versions of ggplot2 contain a function geom_sf which supports plotting sf objects directly, so lets try it…\n\n\n\nThat does not seem to work… the reason is that, even though we removed the data of non European countries, we never changed the bbox setting of our data. The bbox object sets the longitude and latitude range for our plot, which is still for the whole Europe. To change this we can use the st_crop function as\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re familiar with the ggplot2 workflow, it is now easy to construct the aesthetic mappings like you’re used to.

    "text": "Preface\nWe have entered the age of human geography. It is a dynamic and ever-evolving discipline that explores the complex relationship between people, places, and the environment. It seeks to understand how human societies develop, organize space, interact with nature, and shape the world around them. This lecture series aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental themes of human geography, equipping students with the analytical tools needed to examine global patterns, regional differences, and the challenges of an interconnected world.\nThis course covers a broad range of topics, beginning with an introduction to the core principles of human geography before delving into key areas such as population dynamics, cultural landscapes, economic development, urbanization, political structures, and environmental sustainability. We will explore the forces driving globalization, the impacts of climate change, and the role of human decision-making in shaping landscapes and societies.\nThroughout this lecture series, students will engage with real-world case studies, interactive discussions, and critical thinking exercises to connect theory with practice. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of the spatial organization of human activities and their consequences at local, national, and global scales.\nAs we embark on this academic journey, I encourage students to approach each topic with curiosity and a critical mindset. Human geography is not just a subject of study—it is a lens through which we can better understand the challenges and opportunities of our world today.\nThis lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R that has powerful data processing, visualization and geospatial capabilities. The lecture is divided into two sections:\n\nSection 1: Foundations of human geography\nSection 2: Elegant geographic plots in R\n\nGeo-computation with R will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data.\n\nLectures\nSection 1: Foundations of human geography\n\nLecture 1: Introduction to human geography\nLecture 2: Population and health geography\nLecture 3: Global inequality and development\nLecture 4: Cultural geography: Language, religion, and identity\nLecture 5: Political geography: States and geopolitics\nLecture 6: Urban geography: Cities, infrastructure, and planning\nLecture 7: Economic geography: Trade and globalization\nLecture 8: Environmental geography: Resources and sustainability\nLecture 9: Agricultural geography: Food production and land use\nLecture 10: Industrial geography: Industry and trade\n\nSection 2: Elegant geographic plots in R\n\nLecture 11: Human geography lab_1\nLecture 12: Human geography lab_2\nLecture 13: Human geography lab_3\nLecture 14: Human geography lab_4\nLecture 15: Human geography lab_5\n\nTextbooks:\nFor lectures 1 - 10:\n\nRubenstein, J.
