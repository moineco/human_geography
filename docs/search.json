    "text": "Preface\nWe have entered the age of human geography, in which the global economy has become fused with geopolitical strategy. Human geography have impact not only on the public policy, but also on the management of private sector companies that do business globally. Hundreds of thousands of organizations are using geographic information system (GIS) to make maps that communicate, perform analysis, share information, and solve complex problems around the world. This human geography course basically deals with GIS, a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it.\nThis lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R that has powerful data processing, visualization and geospatial capabilities. The lecture is divided into three parts:\n\nPart I: Foundations of human geography\nPart II: Foundations of geographic plots in R\nPart III: Elegant geographic plots in R\n\nGeo-computation with R will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data.\n\nLectures\nSection 1: Foundations of human geography\n\nLecture 1: Introduction to human geography\nLecture 2: Population\nLecture 3: Migration\nLecture 4: Local culture, popular culture, and cultural landscapes\nLecture 5: Identity: Race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality\nLecture 6: Political geography\nLecture 7: Urban geography\nLecture 8: The humanized environment\n\nSection 2: Foundations of geographic plots in R\n\nLecture 9: Processing shapefiles in R\nLecture 10: Basic maps with R\n\nSection 3: Elegant geographic plots in R\n\nLecture 11: Human geography of Africa\nLecture 12: Human geography of Asia\nLecture 13: Human geography of Australia\nLecture 14: Human geography of Europe\nLecture 15: Human geography of North America\n\nTextbooks:\nFor lectures 1 - 8:\n\nRubenstein, J.

Final examination (TBA)\n50%\n\n\n\n\n\nQuizzes and assignment submission\nRegarding the quizzes and assignments, you have to write 10 - 200 words in English to get evaluated. Writing with logical explanation and examples are the main criteria of evaluation. If you can create exceptional arguments to support your discussion, I will provide bonus points for that assignment.\n\n\nInstructor\nMoinul Islam, Associate Professor, Research Institute for Future Design & School of Economics and Management, Kochi University of Technology, Japan.\nOffice hours: By appointment, please email:\n\ngeoinformatics.moinul@gmail.com",

    "text": "1.1 Branches of Geography\nThe word geography, invented by the ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes, is based on two Greek words, “Geo” means “Earth,” and “Graphy” means “to write.” Geography is the study of where things are found on Earth’s surface and the reasons for their locations.\nHuman geographers ask two questions:\nTo introduce human geography, we concentrate on two main features of society: culture and economy. The lectures explain why the most important cultural features, such as languages, religions, and ethnicities, are arranged as they are across Earth. The lecture also looks at the distribution of the most important economic activities, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services.\nHumans possess a strong sense of place—that is, a feeling for the features that contribute to the distinctiveness of a particular spot on Earth—perhaps a hometown, vacation destination, or college. Describing the features of a place is an essential building block for geographers to explain similarities, differences, and changes across Earth.\nGeographers describe a feature’s place on Earth by identifying its location, which is the position that something occupies on Earth’s surface. In doing so, they consider three ways to identify location: place name, site, and situation. Geographers analyze where particular places are located and the combination of features that make each place on Earth distinct. Because all inhabited places on Earth’s surface—and many uninhabited places—have been named, the most straightforward way to describe a particular location is often by referring to its place name.",
