<p>I will explore different packages that could help with mapping geographical data, specifically for the USA. At first we need to load necessary packages to execute the maps for this lecture.</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>Spatial data are best analyzed by visualization through maps. This chapter covers two types of spatial data. One is spatial point data, which can be plotted as a set of points on a map. The other is spatial polygon data, which represent a sequence of connected points on a map corresponding to the boundaries of certain areas such as counties, districts, and provinces. We also consider spatial–temporal data, which are a set of spatial point or polygon data recorded over time, revealing changes in spatial patterns over time.</p>
<p>First we can load necessary packages by using <code>pacman</code>.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>pacman<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">p_load</span>(maps, animation, DT)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>In R, the maps package provides various mapping tools as well as many spatial databases. The package contains a spatial database of various cities in the world. For example, it includes a data frame of US cities called us.cities. Any built-in data frame can be loaded by using the data() function. Below, we show the first few observations of this data set, which contains the name (as the name variable), state (country.etc), population (pop), latitude (lat), longitude (long), and whether the city is the capital of the country (capital = 1), the capital of a state (capital = 2), or neither (capital = 0).</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">data</span>(<span class="st">"us.cities"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">head</span>(us.cities)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>        name country.etc    pop   lat    long capital
1 Abilene TX          TX 113888 32.45  -99.74       0
2   Akron OH          OH 206634 41.08  -81.52       0
3 Alameda CA          CA  70069 37.77 -122.26       0
4  Albany GA          GA  75510 31.58  -84.18       0
5  Albany NY          NY  93576 42.67  -73.80       2
6  Albany OR          OR  45535 44.62 -123.09       0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we can add state capitals to the map of the United States. We can use the map() function to access one spatial database and visualize the data therein. For example, in order to plot the United States, we set the database argument to “usa”. Spatial points can be easily added to maps using the points() function with their longitude and latitude information as the inputs for the x and y coordinates, respectively. Each state capital is represented by a solid circle whose size is proportional to its population. We can add a title by using the title() function after a map is drawn.</p>

<p>In R, the rgb() function helps create hexadecimal color codes from numerical values. The three arguments, red, green, and blue, take the intensity of each color, ranging from 0 to 1, which gets translated into an integer value from 0 to 255 and then represented as a hexadecimal numeral. In addition, we can create more than one color code from rgb() at a time. The arguments can take vectors of length longer than 1. Below are some examples of hexadecimal color code.</p>

<p>Finally, we can create purple (50% red and 50% blue) and yellow (100% red and 100% green). The rgb() function can take a vector of inputs, as illustrated in this example.</p>

<p>Another advantage of using hexadecimal color codes is that we can make the colors (partly) transparent by adding two additional digits, from 00 to FF, to the end of a hexadecimal color code. This enables us to control the level of transparency. Again, it is easier to think about the intensity scale from 0 to 1 and use the rgb() function to transform it to a hexadecimal color code. The function takes a fourth argument alpha, which can be used for this purpose. An example is given here.</p>

<p>Once we know the hexadecimal colors, we can use them (as a character object) in our plots in the same way that we have been using named colors like “red” and “blue”. In the following plot, semitransparent circles can be easily distinguished even when they overlap, whereas it is harder to distinguish between nontransparent circles.</p>

<p>We now color the map of California in two ways. First, we color it as a blue state because Obama won California in 2008. Second, we color it using the RGB color scheme based on the two-party vote share.</p>

<p>We will repeat this for all states using a loop. The map does not include Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington DC, so we will skip those states. Note that we will set the add argument to TRUE in order to add a color to each state. A loop is used because we color one state at a time.</p>

<p>The data set contains three different types of stores, represented by the variable type. Wal-MartStore represents a standard Walmart store, whereas SuperCenter is a standard Walmart store as well as a full supermarket. Walmart Supercenters often include pharma- cies, garden shops, car service centers, and other specialty centers. We also plot DistributionCenter data, representing stores that distribute food and goods to standard Walmart stores and Supercenters.</p>
