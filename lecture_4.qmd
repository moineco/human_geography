# Cultural geography: Language, religion, and identity

### Definition

-   Cultural geography studies how culture, traditions, and social identity vary across space and interact with geography.
-   Includes language, religion, ethnicity, customs, traditions, and symbols.

### Why it matters

-   7,000+ languages spoken globally, but many are disappearing.
-   Religious beliefs shape societies, conflicts, and global politics.
-   Identity and culture influence migration, nationalism, and globalization.

## Key Questions in Cultural Geography

-   How does geography shape culture and identity?
-   Why are some languages and religions dominant while others decline?
-   What role does globalization play in cultural diffusion and conflict?
-   How does language and religion shape political and social structures?

## Language and Geography

### The Role of Language in Culture

-   Language defines cultural identity, history, and communication.
-   Linguistic Geography: Studies the spatial distribution of languages.
-   Language families: Groups of related languages evolving from a common ancestor.

Major Language Families (World Distribution)

| Language Family | Examples | Regions |
|----|----|----|
| Indo-European | English, Spanish, Hindi, Russian | Europe, Americas, South Asia |
| Sino-Tibetan | Mandarin, Cantonese | East Asia |
| Afro-Asiatic | Arabic, Hebrew | Middle East, North Africa |
| Niger-Congo | Swahili, Yoruba | Sub-Saharan Africa |
| Dravidian | Tamil, Telugu | South India |
| Austroasiatic | Khmer, Vietnamese | Southeast Asia |

### Language Diffusion and Extinction

Language Spread:

-   Colonialism and trade spread Indo-European languages (e.g., English, Spanish).
-   Religious influence (e.g., Arabic spread with Islam).

Endangered Languages:

-   Half of world languages may disappear by 2100 (UNESCO).
-   Causes: Urbanization, globalization, national language policies.
-   Example: Welsh and Māori being revived through education and policy.

Case Study: The Decline of Indigenous Languages in Canada

-   Over 70 Indigenous languages exist in Canada, but most are endangered.
-   Policies like Indian Residential Schools suppressed Indigenous languages.
-   Government-funded language programs aim for revitalization.

## Religion and Geography

### The Spatial Distribution of Religions

Religion influences settlement patterns, traditions, and political systems.

Two Major Types:

-   Universalizing Religions (seek converts, global presence): Christianity, Islam, Buddhism.
-   Ethnic Religions (linked to ethnicity, localized): Hinduism, Judaism, Shintoism.

| Religion | Major Regions | Universalizing/Ethnic |
|----|----|----|
| Christianity | Americas, Europe, Africa | Universalizing |
| Islam | Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Asia | Universalizing |
| Hinduism | India, Nepal | Ethnic |
| Buddhism | East Asia, Southeast Asia | Universalizing |
| Judaism | Israel, North America | Ethnic |

Religious Landscapes

-   Sacred sites: Mecca (Islam), Jerusalem (Christianity, Islam, Judaism), Varanasi (Hinduism).
-   Religious structures: Mosques, churches, temples.

Religion and Cultural Conflict

Religious conflicts often arise due to territorial disputes or differing ideologies.

Examples:

-   Israel-Palestine conflict (Judaism vs. Islam).
-   India-Pakistan tensions over Kashmir (Hinduism vs. Islam).
-   Northern Ireland conflict (Catholics vs. Protestants).

Case Study: Secularism in France

-   France has strict secularism policies banning religious symbols in public schools.
-   Debate: Are such policies protecting neutrality or restricting religious freedom?

## Identity, Ethnicity, and Cultural Landscapes

### What is Identity?

-   Identity is shaped by language, religion, ethnicity, and history.
-   Cultural landscapes: How human activities shape the physical environment.

### Ethnicity and Geography

-   Ethnic enclaves: Communities preserving cultural identity (e.g., Chinatowns).
-   Diasporas: Ethnic groups spread globally (e.g., Jewish and Indian diasporas).
-   Multiculturalism: The coexistence of multiple cultures in one place.
    -   Example: Canada’s multicultural policies vs. France’s assimilation policies.

Case Study: Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar

-   Rohingya Muslims face persecution in Myanmar due to ethnic and religious differences.
-   Mass displacement to Bangladesh (1 million refugees).
-   Global debate over human rights and national identity.

## Cultural Diffusion and Globalization

### Types of Cultural Diffusion

-   Relocation Diffusion: Migration spreads culture (e.g., Spanish in Latin America).
-   Hierarchical Diffusion: Ideas spread from elites (e.g., fashion, technology).
-   Contagious Diffusion: Rapid spread (e.g., social media trends).

### Globalization and Cultural Change

Pros of Globalization:

-   Cultural exchange (e.g., McDonald's, Bollywood).
-   Economic growth and diversity.

Cons of Globalization:

-   Cultural homogenization (e.g., loss of Indigenous traditions).
-   Westernization overpowering local customs.

Case Study: Americanization vs. Cultural Resistance

-   Hollywood movies dominate global media, but some countries resist.
-   France promotes French films to protect its cultural identity.

## Takeaway

-   Language, religion, and identity are central to cultural geography.
-   Globalization is reshaping cultural landscapes, but local traditions persist.
-   Conflicts arise when cultural identities clash over land, politics, and beliefs.
