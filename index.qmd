# Preface {.unnumbered}

We have entered the age of human geography. It is a dynamic and ever-evolving discipline that explores the complex relationship between people, places, and the environment. It seeks to understand how human societies develop, organize space, interact with nature, and shape the world around them. This lecture series aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental themes of human geography, equipping students with the analytical tools needed to examine global patterns, regional differences, and the challenges of an interconnected world.

This course covers a broad range of topics, beginning with an introduction to the core principles of human geography before delving into key areas such as population dynamics, cultural landscapes, economic development, urbanization, political structures, and environmental sustainability. We will explore the forces driving globalization, the impacts of climate change, and the role of human decision-making in shaping landscapes and societies.

Throughout this lecture series, students will engage with real-world case studies, interactive discussions, and critical thinking exercises to connect theory with practice. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of the spatial organization of human activities and their consequences at local, national, and global scales.

As we embark on this academic journey, I encourage students to approach each topic with curiosity and a critical mindset. Human geography is not just a subject of studyâ€”it is a lens through which we can better understand the challenges and opportunities of our world today.

This lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on **R** that has powerful data processing, visualization and geospatial capabilities. The lecture is divided into two sections:

-   Section 1: Foundations of human geography
-   Section 2: Elegant geographic plots in R

Geo-computation with **R** will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data.

### Grading

Your grade evaluation will depend on following three factors:

| Performance                    | Weight |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| a\. Attendance                 | 10%    |
| b\. Answering the quizzes and assignments. | 40%    |
| c\. Final examination (TBA)    | 50%    |

### Quizzes and assignment submission

Regarding the quizzes and assignments, you have to write 10 - 200 words in English to get evaluated. Writing with logical explanation and examples are the main criteria of evaluation. If you can create exceptional arguments to support your discussion, I will provide bonus points for that assignment.
