# Lecture 2: Population and health geography

Definition:

-   Population geography studies the spatial distribution, density, and dynamics of human populations.
-   Health geography examines the spatial patterns of health, disease, and healthcare access.

Why It Matters:

-   World population surpassed 8 billion in 2023 (UN estimate).
-   Uneven distribution of population and healthcare creates social and economic challenges.
-   Population change influences urbanization, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

### Fundamental Questions in Population Geography

-   Where do people live? (Population distribution & density)
-   How is the population changing? (Growth, decline, migration)
-   Why do these changes happen? (Fertility, mortality, economic & social factors)
-   How do population changes affect resources and policies?

## Understanding Population Distribution

### Global Population Distribution

Uneven Distribution:

-   90% of the world’s population lives in the Northern Hemisphere.
-   Most people live near coastlines, rivers, and fertile land.
-   Only \~30% of Earth's land is habitable for dense populations.

Factors Influencing Population Distribution:

#### Physical Factors

-   Climate (e.g., dense populations in temperate regions).
-   Landforms (e.g., river valleys vs. deserts).
-   Natural resources (e.g., oil-rich regions).

#### Human Factors

-   Political stability and governance.
-   Economic opportunities (e.g., industrial hubs).
-   Cultural and historical reasons (e.g., religious sites).

#### Case Study: Population Density in Asia

China and India account for 35% of the world's population due to:

-   Fertile lands (Ganges & Yangtze river valleys).
-   Monsoon climate supporting agriculture.
-   Historical urbanization and trade centers.

## Population Growth and Decline

### Measuring Population Growth

Crude Birth Rate (CBR): Number of births per 1,000 people per year.

Crude Death Rate (CDR): Number of deaths per 1,000 people per year.

Natural Increase Rate (NIR):

-   Formula: NIR = CBR - CDR
-   If NIR \> 0, population grows; if NIR \< 0, population declines.

#### Demographic Transition Model (DTM)

A model explaining how populations change over time in response to economic and social progress.

| Stage | Characteristics | Example Countries |
|----|----|----|
| 1: Pre-Industrial | High birth & death rates, slow growth | Isolated tribes (Amazon, Congo) |
| 2: Early Industrial | Declining death rate, high birth rate, rapid growth | Nigeria, Afghanistan |
| 3: Late Industrial | Declining birth rate, slower growth | Mexico, India |
| 4: Post-Industrial | Low birth & death rates, stable growth | USA, Canada |
| 5: Declining | Low birth rate, aging population, negative growth | Japan, Italy |

Example: Japan’s Aging Population (Stage 5)

- Population shrinking due to low fertility rate (1.3 children per woman).
- Impacts: Labor shortages, rising healthcare costs, increased retirement age.
- Government response: Encouraging immigration and family-friendly policies.

## Fertility, Mortality, and Migration
### Factors Affecting Fertility Rates

High Fertility Rates (Developing Countries)

- Limited access to contraception.
- Cultural/religious preferences for large families.
- Rural economies dependent on children for labor.

Low Fertility Rates (Developed Countries)

- Economic cost of raising children.
- Increased education and employment for women.
- Urbanization reducing family size.

### Causes of Mortality (Death Rates)

- Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): Deaths of infants <1 year per 1,000 live births.
- Life Expectancy: Average lifespan of a population.

Example: Sub-Saharan Africa (High Mortality)

- Leading causes: Malaria, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, lack of healthcare.
- Efforts to reduce: Vaccination programs, improved sanitation, healthcare funding.

### Migration Patterns

- Push Factors (forcing people to leave): War, poverty, natural disasters.
- Pull Factors (attracting people): Job opportunities, political stability, better education.

Examples of Large-Scale Migrations:

- Syrian Refugee Crisis (2011–present): Millions fleeing war.
- Rural-to-urban migration in China: 300 million+ people moving to cities.

## Health Geography
### What is Health Geography?

Examines how location affects health and disease spread.

Key topics:

- Epidemiology (disease spread).
- Healthcare access and inequalities.
- Environmental health risks.

### Disease Patterns and Epidemics

- Endemic: Constantly present in a population (e.g., malaria in Africa).
- Epidemic: Sudden outbreak in a region (e.g., Ebola in 2014).
- Pandemic: Global outbreak (e.g., COVID-19).

Example: COVID-19 Pandemic (2020–Present)

- Origin: Wuhan, China.
- Spread: Global air travel, urban density.
- Impact: Healthcare strain, lockdowns, economic crisis.

Role of Geography:

- GIS mapping for tracking cases.
- Urban density affecting transmission.
- Global cooperation in vaccine distribution.

### Healthcare Access and Inequality

- Developed Countries: Universal healthcare, advanced hospitals.
- Developing Countries: Poor access, high disease rates.

Example: Healthcare Disparities in the USA

- Urban areas have better hospitals vs. rural regions with limited access.
- Minority groups have higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy.

## Key takeaways:

- Global population is unevenly distributed.
- Fertility and mortality rates shape population trends.
- Health geography is critical for disease control and healthcare policy.

- How does population growth impact economic development?
- What factors contribute to low fertility rates in some countries?
- How has COVID-19 changed global health geography?
