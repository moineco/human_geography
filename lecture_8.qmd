# Economic geography: Trade and globalization

### Definition

-   Economic geography examines how economic activities are distributed across space, including industries, trade, and globalization.

### Why it matters

-   Economic geography helps explain why some regions are wealthy while others remain poor.
-   Globalization has reshaped trade, labor markets, and industry locations.
-   Technology and transportation advancements have changed the economic landscape.

### Key Questions in Economic Geography

-   Why are industries and businesses located in certain places?
-   How do global trade and economic policies shape economies?
-   What are the impacts of globalization on industry, labor, and development?
-   How do economic activities affect environmental sustainability?

## Industrial Geography: The Location of Industries

### Industrial Revolution and Economic Development

-   The Industrial Revolution (1750–1850) transformed economies from agriculture to industry.
-   Factories and mass production replaced manual labor → rapid urbanization.
-   New transportation networks (railways, ships) boosted trade.

### Factors Influencing Industrial Location

Alfred Weber’s Least Cost Theory (1909):

-   Industries locate based on minimizing transportation, labor, and agglomeration costs.
-   Example: Car manufacturing in Detroit due to skilled labor and access to steel.

| Factor | Description | Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Raw Materials | Proximity to resources reduces transport costs | Coal mines in Pennsylvania |
| Labor Supply | Skilled/unskilled workers influence location | Tech companies in Silicon Valley |
| Market Access | Industries locate near customers | Fashion industry in Paris |
| Infrastructure | Roads, ports, airports affect distribution | Singapore as a global shipping hub |
| Government Policies | Tax incentives, trade zones attract businesses | Special Economic Zones in China |

#### Case Study: Silicon Valley – A Global Tech Hub

Why in California?

-   Proximity to universities (Stanford, Berkeley).
-   Investment from venture capitalists.
-   Climate and lifestyle attract talent.

## Global Trade and Economic Systems

### Types of Economic Systems

| Economic System | Characteristics | Example Countries |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Capitalist (Market Economy) | Private ownership, free trade | USA, UK, Canada |
| Socialist (Planned Economy) | Government controls resources, limited private ownership | China, Cuba |
| Mixed Economy | Combination of private and public sectors | Germany, Sweden |

### Global Trade Networks

-   International trade connects producers and consumers across countries.

-   Key Trade Agreements and Organizations:

    -   World Trade Organization (WTO): Regulates global trade.
    -   North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA → USMCA): Trade between USA, Canada, Mexico.
    -   European Union (EU): Economic and trade integration among member states.
    -   Belt and Road Initiative (China): Massive infrastructure and trade project.

Case Study: China’s Role in Global Trade

-   "The World’s Factory": Largest exporter of goods.
-   Relies on cheap labor, strong infrastructure, and manufacturing expertise.
-   US-China trade tensions impact global markets.

## Globalization and Economic Change

### What is Globalization?

-   Globalization is the increasing interconnectedness of economies, cultures, and politics worldwide.

-   Driven by:

    -   Technology advancements (Internet, digital banking).
    -   Trade liberalization (lower tariffs, free trade).
    -   Multinational corporations (MNCs) (e.g., Apple, Amazon).

### Impacts of Globalization

Positive Effects:

-   Increased global trade and economic growth.
-   Access to new markets and job opportunities.
-   Faster technology diffusion.

Negative Effects:

-   Job losses in some industries due to outsourcing.
-   Exploitation of workers in developing nations.
-   Environmental damage (deforestation, pollution).

Case Study: Outsourcing and Job Shifts

-   Nike and Apple manufacture in Asia due to low labor costs.
-   Pros: Low-cost products for consumers.
-   Cons: Worker exploitation (low wages, poor conditions).

## Economic Development and Inequality

### Measuring Economic Development

| Indicator | Description | Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| GDP per capita | Total economic output per person | USA: \$75,000 vs. India: \$6,000 |
| Human Development Index (HDI) | Combines income, education, life expectancy | Norway: 0.957 vs. Chad: 0.394 |
| Gini Coefficient | Measures income inequality (0 = equal, 1 = extreme inequality) | South Africa: 0.63 vs. Sweden: 0.25 |

#### Case Study: The Global North vs. Global South Divide

Global North (Developed Nations)

-   High incomes, industrialized economies (USA, Germany, Japan).

Global South (Developing Nations)

-   Lower incomes, reliance on agriculture (Bangladesh, Nigeria).

Efforts to bridge the gap: UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), microfinance, fair trade.

## Sustainable Economic Growth and the Future

### Sustainable Development Strategies

-   Renewable Energy Investment: Solar, wind power to reduce carbon footprint.
-   Fair Trade Policies: Ensuring workers receive fair wages.
-   Green Supply Chains: Reducing pollution in global manufacturing.
-   Circular Economy: Recycling and waste reduction.

Case Study: Green Economy in Germany

-   Germany leads in renewable energy (solar, wind).
-   Government incentives for sustainable industries.

## Takeaway

-   Economic geography helps explain how industries, trade, and globalization shape economies.
-   Industries are strategically located based on resources, labor, and markets.
-   Globalization has benefits but also challenges (inequality, job shifts).
-   Sustainable economic strategies are crucial for future growth.
