# Environmental geography: Resources, sustainability, and climate change

Definition:

-   Environmental geography studies the interactions between humans and their natural environment, including resource use, sustainability, and climate change.

Why It Matters:

-   Human activities have altered the Earth’s ecosystems.
-   Natural resource depletion threatens global stability.
-   Climate change is reshaping societies, economies, and politics.

### Key Questions in Environmental Geography

-   How do human activities impact the environment?
-   What are the challenges of managing natural resources?
-   How can sustainability balance economic growth and environmental protection?
-   What are the causes and consequences of climate change?

## Natural Resources and Their Management

### Types of Natural Resources

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Renewable Resources | Can be replenished naturally over time | Solar, wind, forests, water |
| Non-Renewable Resources | Finite supply, takes millions of years to form | Coal, oil, natural gas, minerals |
| Perpetual Resources | Always available, not affected by human use | Sunlight, wind, ocean waves |

Case Study: The Amazon Rainforest and Resource Exploitation

-   Deforestation for agriculture (soy, cattle ranching) and logging.
-   Loss of biodiversity and carbon storage capacity.
-   Efforts to manage: Brazil’s reforestation programs, Indigenous land rights.

### The Tragedy of the Commons (Garrett Hardin, 1968)

-   Shared resources (oceans, forests, atmosphere) are often overused and degraded.
-   Example: Over-fishing in international waters leads to fish population collapse.
-   Solutions: Regulation, conservation policies, sustainable resource management.

## Sustainability and Development

### What is Sustainability?

-   Sustainability means meeting current needs without compromising future generations.

-   The Three Pillars of Sustainability:

    -   Environmental: Protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.
    -   Economic: Sustainable business practices and green technologies.
    -   Social: Reducing inequality and improving living standards.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

-   The UN’s 17 SDGs aim to balance economic growth with environmental protection.

-   Key SDGs related to environmental geography:

    -   Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy.
    -   Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production.
    -   Goal 13: Climate action.

Case Study: Denmark – A Leader in Renewable Energy

-   Invested heavily in wind energy, now generating 50% of electricity from renewables.
-   Green building designs and sustainable urban planning.

## Climate Change and Its Impact

### What is Climate Change?

-   Long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather patterns.

-   Causes:

    -   Natural Factors (volcanic eruptions, solar radiation).
    -   Human Activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation).

### Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming

-   Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere.

-   Main GHGs:

    -   Carbon dioxide (CO₂) – Burning fossil fuels.
    -   Methane (CH₄) – Agriculture, livestock.
    -   Nitrous oxide (N₂O) – Fertilizers, industrial processes.

-   Global temperature has risen by \~1.2°C since pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2023).

Case Study: Rising Sea Levels and Coastal Cities

-   Maldives, Bangladesh, and Florida face flooding due to rising oceans.
-   Solutions: Sea walls, climate migration planning, carbon reduction.

## Environmental Challenges and Policies

### Deforestation and Land Degradation

-   Causes: Agriculture, logging, infrastructure expansion.
-   Impacts: Loss of biodiversity, increased CO₂ emissions.
-   Solution: Reforestation, agroforestry, sustainable land management.

### Air and Water Pollution

-   Causes: Industrial waste, vehicle emissions, plastics in oceans.
-   Impacts: Health issues (lung diseases, waterborne illnesses). = Solution: Green technology, emissions regulations, waste recycling.

Case Study: China’s Air Pollution Crisis

-   Rapid industrialization led to smog-filled cities.
-   Government action: Air quality monitoring, coal reduction, electric vehicles.

### Global Environmental Policies and Agreements

| Agreement | Purpose | Example of Action |
|----|----|----|
| Kyoto Protocol (1997) | Reduce greenhouse gas emissions | First international climate treaty |
| Paris Agreement (2015) | Limit global warming to below 2°C | Countries set emission reduction goals |
| Montreal Protocol (1987) | Protect ozone layer | Banned CFCs in aerosol sprays |

## Solutions for a Sustainable Future
### Renewable Energy Transition

- Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy replacing fossil fuels.
- Example: Germany’s “Energiewende” policy promotes renewable electricity.

### Circular Economy and Waste Management

- Recycling and reusing materials to minimize waste.
- Plastic bans and biodegradable packaging.
- Example: Sweden recycles 99% of household waste.

### Green Urban Planning

- Sustainable cities with efficient public transport and green spaces.
- Vertical farming and smart water management.
- Example: Singapore’s eco-friendly city design.**

## Takeaway

- Environmental geography helps us understand human impact on natural systems.
- Sustainability requires balancing environmental, economic, and social goals.
- Climate change is a major challenge, requiring global cooperation.
