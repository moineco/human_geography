## 授業の目的 

This course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of human geography and the skills to analyze geographic data using R. Each lesson has specific objectives that contribute to the overall learning goals.

Section 1: Know the foundations of human geography

Section 2: Use the elegant geographic plots in R

Note: All lecture notes, assignments and quizzes will be available through KUTLMS Moodle. 

## 授業の概要  

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to human geography, focusing on key themes such as population dynamics, migration, cultural landscapes, and urban development. Additionally, students will learn fundamental techniques for processing and visualizing geographic data using R, applying these skills to real-world geographic analyses across different regions of the world.

Section 1: Know the foundations of human geography

The first section establishes the core principles of human geography, exploring how human societies interact with their environments. Topics include:

- The basics of human geography, including spatial patterns and human-environment interactions.
    
- Population trends, migration patterns, and their effects on societies.

- Cultural geography, identity formation, and political structures.
    
- The organization of cities and urban spaces, as well as environmental impacts of human activities.

Section 2: Use the elegant geographic plots in R

This section introduces essential geographic data processing techniques, with a focus on:

- Handling and analyzing shapefiles using R.

- Creating basic maps to visualize geographic data effectively.

- Explore human geography case studies from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.
    
- Develop advanced mapping techniques to represent human geographic trends in each region.

## 到達目標 

The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of human geography while equipping them with practical skills in geographic data visualization using R. By integrating theoretical knowledge with hands-on data analysis, the course aims to acquire:

- Develop a strong foundation in human geography: Students will be able to understand key themes such as population dynamics, migration, cultural landscapes, political geography, and urban development. Understanding these topics will help them analyze how human societies interact with their environments and shape the world.

- Enhance analytical and critical thinking skills: Through the study of real-world geographic issues, students will develop the ability to assess spatial patterns, interpret demographic trends, and evaluate the impact of human activities on different regions.

- Introduce geographic data processing and visualization: By learning to work with spatial data in R, students will gain essential technical skills, including processing shapefiles, creating maps, and visualizing geographic trends.

- Apply knowledge to regional case studies: The course will provide opportunities to apply geographic analysis techniques to different world regions, helping students understand diverse cultural, political, and environmental contexts.
