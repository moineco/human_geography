# Lecture 9: Agricultural geography – food production, land use, and rural development

Definition:

-   Agricultural geography examines the spatial patterns of agriculture, food production, land use, and rural development.
-   It explores how, where, and why agriculture takes place, and its role in shaping economies and societies.

Why It Matters:

-   Agriculture feeds the world’s population and drives economies.
-   Climate change, resource depletion, and land use changes impact food security.
-   Rural development influences migration, urbanization, and sustainability.

### Key Questions in Agricultural Geography

-   What are the major agricultural systems and their distribution?
-   How has agriculture changed over time with technology and globalization?
-   What are the impacts of land use changes on food production and the environment?
-   How can rural areas develop sustainably while maintaining agricultural production?

## Agricultural Systems and Land Use Patterns

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Subsistence Agriculture | Small-scale, for local consumption, minimal technology | Slash-and-burn farming in Amazon, rice farming in Bangladesh |
| Commercial Agriculture | Large-scale, profit-driven, high technology | Industrial grain farming in the U.S., palm oil plantations in Indonesia |
| Pastoralism | Herding animals for food and trade | Nomadic herding in Mongolia, cattle ranching in Brazil |
| Plantation Agriculture | Monoculture farming, export-oriented | Tea plantations in India, coffee farms in Colombia |
| Urban Agriculture | Food production in cities | Rooftop gardens in New York, hydroponics in Singapore |

## Agricultural Revolutions and Their Impact

### The First Agricultural Revolution (\~10,000 BCE)

-   Domestication of plants and animals → shift from hunting-gathering to farming.
-   Impact: Population growth, permanent settlements, early civilizations.

### The Second Agricultural Revolution (17th-19th Century)

-   New farming techniques (crop rotation, plowing).
-   Mechanization (seed drill, fertilizers) → higher productivity.
-   Impact: Rural-urban migration, industrialization, food surplus.

### The Green Revolution (1950s-1970s)

-   Introduction of high-yield crops, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation.

-   Led to global increases in food production, but also environmental concerns.

    Case Study: Green Revolution in India

    -   Success: Increased wheat and rice production, reducing famine.
    -   Challenges: Soil degradation, water depletion, farmer debt.

## Food Security and Challenges in Agriculture

### What is Food Security?

-   Food security = People have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food.

-   FAO’s Four Pillars of Food Security:

    -   Availability – Enough food supply.
    -   Access – People can afford food.
    -   Utilization – Nutritional quality matters.
    -   Stability – Food supply is consistent over time.

### Challenges to Global Food Security

| Challenge | Causes | Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Climate Change | Droughts, floods, temperature rise | Desertification in Sub-Saharan Africa |
| Soil Degradation | Overuse of fertilizers, deforestation | Salinization in the Middle East |
| Water Scarcity | Over-irrigation, pollution | Water crisis in California agriculture |
| Land Use Change | Urbanization, deforestation | Loss of farmland in China |
| Food Waste | Poor storage, consumer habits | 30% of global food wasted annually |

Case Study: Famine in the Horn of Africa

-   Drought, conflict, and poor infrastructure have led to food crises.
-   Solutions: Food aid, drought-resistant crops, irrigation improvements.

## Rural Development and Sustainable Agriculture

### What is Rural Development?

-   Improving livelihoods, infrastructure, and economic opportunities in rural areas.
-   Focus on education, healthcare, market access, and technology.

### Strategies for Sustainable Agriculture

| Strategy | Benefits | Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Agroforestry | Combines trees and crops for better soil conservation | Cocoa farming in Ghana |
| Organic Farming | No synthetic pesticides, promotes biodiversity | Organic vegetable farms in France |
| Permaculture | Self-sustaining ecosystems for food production | Regenerative farms in Australia |
| Precision Agriculture | Uses AI, GPS, and drones for efficient farming | Smart farming in the Netherlands |

Case Study: Cuba’s Urban Agriculture Model

-   Following the Soviet collapse, Cuba faced food shortages.
-   Developed urban organic farming (rooftop gardens, local markets).
-   Result: Sustainable food supply in cities.

## Agricultural Trade and Globalization

-   Global food trade connects regions but creates inequalities.

-   Major trends:

    -   Export-oriented agriculture: Latin America supplies soybeans, Africa exports cocoa.
    -   Dependency on imports: Middle Eastern countries import grains.
    -   Trade policies impact farmers: Subsidies in the U.S. and EU create imbalances.

Case Study: Fair Trade Coffee Movement

-   Goal: Ensure small farmers receive fair prices and better working conditions.
-   Impact: Improves farmer income in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

## Future of Agriculture – Innovations and Policies

### Technological Innovations in Agriculture

-   Vertical farming: Hydroponic skyscrapers for urban food production.
-   Lab-grown meat: Reducing environmental impact of livestock farming.
-   AI in farming: Drones and sensors optimize crop health and irrigation.

### Agricultural Policies and Global Governance

| Policy | Goal | Example |
|----|----|----|
| Common Agricultural Policy (EU) | Supports farmers, stabilizes prices | EU subsidies for sustainable farming |
| U.S. Farm Bill | Regulates agriculture, provides subsidies | Crop insurance, food aid programs |
| UN Food Security Programs | Reduces hunger, promotes sustainability | World Food Programme (WFP) |

## Takeaway

- Agriculture is central to food security, economic growth, and rural life.
- Challenges include climate change, resource depletion, and market inequalities.
- Sustainable solutions and technological innovations are key to future food systems
