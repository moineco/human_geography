#  Introduction to human geography

The word geography, invented by the ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes, is based on two Greek words: geo means “Earth,” and graphy means “to write.” Geography is the study of where things are found on Earth's surface and the reasons for their locations. Human geographers ask two questions: Where are people and activities found on Earth? Why are they there?

To introduce human geography, we concentrate on two main features of society: culture and economy. The lectures explain why the most important cultural features, such as languages, religions, and ethnicities, are arranged as they are across Earth. The lecture also looks at the distribution of the most important economic activities, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
